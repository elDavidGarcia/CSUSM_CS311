// INSTRUCTION:
// re-write stack.cpp to use a vector. (vstack.h)
// you don't have top any more but el.size()-1 is the same as top
// isFull always returns false 
// Make sure the comments have been updated!!!
// UNIX Hint:  
// To copy the old stack.cpp from the parent directory here, 
//  cp ../stack.cpp vstack.cpp
