// HW3P2  Instruction: Inherit everything publicly from llist

// put the following in class slist

slist();   // constructor which is the same as the llist one

int search(el_t)
// search through the list to see if any node contains the key.
// If so, return its position (>=1). Otherwise, return 0.

void replace(el_t,  int)
// go to the Ith node (if I is between 1 and Count) and 
// replace the element there with the new element. 
// If I was an illegal value, throw OutOfRange 

// Then create slist.cpp with only the above functions
