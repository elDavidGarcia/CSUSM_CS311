INSTRUCTION:

Must add two functions to dgraph.h and dgraph.cpp

- void visit(int, char) 
 which will enter the given visit number for a given vertex.
 This is to indicate the order in which vertices were visited.
 Do not use a loop to look for the vertex.
 Convert A to slot 0, B to slot 1 etc.

- bool isMarked(char) 
  which returns true if a given vertex was already visited
  (0 means not visited)
  Do not use a loop to look for a vertex

Make sure displayGraph now displays the visit numbers as well.

Create hw7client.cpp that performs DFS of a dgraph.
You will need all the HW6 files plus the stack class files.
The stack elements will be char this time.

Make sure you added very good comments!!!!

Check your output against my hw7.out.
